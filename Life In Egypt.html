<h3>A country rich in history and culture, Egypt is home to one of the orginal wonders of the world.[1] The Giza Pyramids is the only remaining wonder from the 7 Wonders of the World list originally created by Antipater of Sidon. Located about 5 miles (9 km) west of the Nile River near the town of Giza, it is the oldest of the wonders.
Initially standing at 146.6 metres (481 feet), the Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the world for more than 3,800 years. Over time, most of the smooth white limestone casing was removed, which lowered the pyramid's height to the present 138.5 metres (454.4 ft). What is seen today is the underlying core structure. 
The base was measured to be about 230.3 metres (755.6 ft) square, giving a volume of roughly 2.6 million cubic metres (92 million cubic feet), which includes an internal hillock.[1]<br>
<br>
<br>
As famous as the Giza Pyramids are they arn't the only anciet landmark within the country. [2]Abu Simbel is an ancient temple complex, originally cut into a solid rock cliff, in southern Egypt and located at the second cataract of the Nile River. The two temples which comprise the site were created during the reign of Ramesses II.[2]<br>
<br>
<br>
Mount Sinai, tradionally known as جبل موسى in Arabic,is a mountain on the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt. It is possibly the same location as the place where the Islamic phrophet Mousa ( "moo-sa"موسى) received the Torah ("tow-rah"توراة). Aside from famous landmarks, Egypt is home to many Kings and Queens.[3] Hatshepsut also Hatchepsut;"Foremost of Noble Ladies" was the fifth pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt. She was the second historically confirmed female pharaoh, after Sobekneferu.
Hatshepsut came to the throne of Egypt in 1478 BC[3].<br>
<br>
<br>
[4] Menes, also spelled Mena, Meni, or Min, (flourished c. 2925 BCE), is the legendary first king of unified Egypt, who, according to tradition, joined Upper and Lower Egypt in a single centralized monarchy and established ancient Egypt’s 1st dynasty. Manetho, a 3rd-century-BCE Egyptian historian, called him Menes, the 5th-century-BCE Greek historian Herodotus referred to him as Min, and two native-king lists of the 19th dynasty (13th century BCE) call him Meni[4].

Before we dive into useful terms to learn, lets understand what the Arabic language is and its dialect in Egypt.
Arabic, العربية ("al-arabee")is a Semitic language, like Hebrew and Aramaic. 
<br>
<br>
[1] Unlike the latter two, where the former drives from the other, however, Arabic is itself a root language, like Latin. Unlike Latin, it is still widely used and spoken today. Around 292 million people speak it as their first language. Many more people can also understand it as a second language. The Arabic language is written from left to right in a consonant alphabet, which is also called an abjad[1].<br>
<br>
The Arabic language has a 28 letter alphabet. These letters, (many of them) are pronounced much differently than letters in English while some letters are pronounced similarly. For example the letter خ ("khaa") is pronuoucned by making a gargle like sound at the base of the throat, where as the letter ب ("baa") is made by pressing your lips together, much like the letter "B" ("bee").
<br>
<br>

Now that we've had that covered, lets learn Arabic's most widely understood dialect; The Egyptian Dialect![2] Egypt’s film and media industry dominates the Arab world. There’s not a single day when an Egyptian movie, TV series or talk show is not played in an Arab household[2].
That being said, it only makes sense to learn it if you're going to Egypt (or any Arabic speaking country for that matter), right? Bellow you'll find some useful phrases that'll make your time there more enjoyable:
<br>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>  Hello (basic greeting)   /  salaam-alaykum     /      سلام عليكم </li>
<br>
<li> How's it going?       /      izzayaak?         /      ازيك؟  </li>
<br>
<li> All praise due to God  /  (Everythings good)   /  al-hamduliallah    الحمد لله</li>
<br>
<li> Excuse me/Pardon Me   /    low-sumaht    /   لو سمحت</li>
<br>
<li> How much is this?   /   bekam-de?        /     بكم دة</li>
<br>
<li> I need ...     /  ana-eyez       /   انا عيز    </li>
<br>
<li> Okay         /      tamam       /  تمام</li>
<br>
<li> Can I take a picture? /  moomkin-akath-soora? /  ممكن اخد صورة؟</li>
<br>
<li> Where is ...   /  feen  /  فين </li>
<br>
<li> Straight Ahead   /  ala-tool  /  على طول</li>
<br>
<li> I don't know     /  ana-meesh-arf  / انا مش عارف</li>

<h3>
When travelling to foregin countries, it's essential to understand what is considered acceptable and what isn't. Learning the customs, cultures and beliefs within a foregin country is crucial to keeping yourself out of awqward or even dangerous sitiuations.
Bellow are some Do's and Dont's that you should know while in Egypt:

<ul>
<li> Stay in a central location. If you plan to visit a certain location like the Pyramids, it's best practice to book a hotel close to it. Rather than one farther out. It's very easy to get lost.</li>
<br>
<li> Always carry Egyptian currency with you. As well as money you can convert. </li>
<br>
<li> Be aware of the closest ATM or Bank. </li>
<br>
<li> Watch out for phone theft. Never walk with your phone extended outwards from your chest. Being in a car with your window down while on your phone is something to be cautious about as well. </li>
<br>
<li> Keep small change with you. </li>
<br>
<li> Watch out for con-artists. People will appear as beggers or striken with poverty. They will also target you since they clearly see you're not from here. </li>
<br>
<li> Taxis will try to gyp you in paying a higher fare. Ask locals how much it would cost you to get to where your going prior to leaving. Also, opt for Ubers or Lifts.</li>
</ul>
</h3>


<h2 id="Dont's" style="text-align:center" class="headercolor" > Dont's</h2>
<h3>
<li> Don't flaunt your wealth in areas that arn't necessary, like at outdoor markets.</li>
<br>
<li> Don't take pictures of locals without permisson. Especially military workers, if so they may confiscate your phone or ask you to delete it.</li>
<br>
<li> Don't drink the water from the outdoor taps. </li>
<br>
<li> Don't put your feet on a table or point your soles at anyone. This is highly offensive.</li>
<br>
<li> Don't visit Masjids during prayer time, unless intending to pray. </li>
<br>
<li> Don't try to cross heavely congested streets by yourself, unless you have experience in doing so.[1] To foreigners, Egyptian drivers are suicidal. To Egyptians, leaving more than a few centimetres between cars is wasted space.[1]</li>
<br>
<li> Don't be afraid of the wild dogs and cat. They really could care less about you, unless they smell food on you. Of course be cautious nontheless but don't be fazed if you see an Egyptian child face to face with a stray dog. They're harmless, mostly. </li>
</ul>
