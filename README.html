<p class="Pcolor"> Hello! My name is Tasneem and I'm 17 years old when this code was written! Some of my favorite things to do are:</p>  
<ul>
<li class="pointcolor"> Cooking</li>
<li class="pointcolor"> Reading</li>
<li class="pointcolor"> Writing</li>
<li class="pointcolor"> Learning New Languages</li>

<h2 class="headercolor"> Where Do I Live? </h2>
<img src="C:\Users\tasne\OneDrive\Pictures\Saved Pictures\p543958643-4.jpeg">
<p> I currently live in Egypt in a city called Nasr which is in Cairo. I'm orginally from Pennsylvania, a state within America. <br>
 I left America around the end of 2019, so up untill this point I've been in Egypt for about 3 years . I quite like it in Egypt even though it's much different from America.</p>

<h2 class="headercolor"> School Life </h2>
<p> I go to an Arabic Language School for 2 hours in the morning. I learn grammar, vocabulary, sentence strucute and so forth, keys things to learn a language.
 After my morning classes I come home, do my Arabic homework and than start my secular studies (11th grade) through online school. After my secular studies I (usually) practice my coding and do lessons in my coding bootcamp. I practice my code by doing projects, like this one! </p>

 <h2 class="headercolor"> Family </h2>
 <p> I live with my parents and my 3 siblings. I'm the oldest out of the siblings that live with me but the middle-child out of 6 kids! I have 2 sisters and 4 brothers! </p>
 <!-- I'll add to this eventually, when I get more ideas!-->

 <h2 class="headercolor"> Career </h2>
 <p> I aspire to be many things in my lifetime some of which are Software Developer, Chemist, Archicute, Professinol Photographer and much more. I am currently working on becoming a Software Developer! </p>
